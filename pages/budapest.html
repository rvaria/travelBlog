        <p> Budapest had a range of spectacular locations, most of which we were able to visit
            whilst I was there. One of the first places we went to was Buda Castle. It took a
            good couple of hours to go around the place fully but it was filled with spectacular
            sights and a deep history.
        </p>
        <p> From Buda Castle, there was a great view of the city, although unfortunately,
            it happened to be quite cloudy specifically whilst I was at the castle. Later on
            in the day the weather warmed up a little and we made our way to Gellert Hill Waterfall.
            Climbing to the top of it gave another view of the city from a different angle.
        </p>
        <p> We then drove further central to have a traditional Hungarian meal known as LÃ¡ngos.
            After that delicious meal we made our way to Heroes' Square.
